              Those of you just struggling to get started in freelance writing are probably eager to learn the best way to compose an article. Those of you who are old hands at writing may be surprised to learn that you have been doing it wrong for years.
              That is why I have set sail around the internet to find some of the best techniques and routines, which when combined with my own limited experience and shrewd observations, are a guaranteed recipe for creating your next masterpiece.

              Before you can get started, there are some basic supplies that you will need. Some you will actually use. Others will just serve to make you feel all official and important.
              You still need them though, because feeling official and important is part of the psychology that makes you get up everyday and face your job with a "can-do" attitude. So, search your house or your local store ASAP and gather these things:
            </p>
          </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default About;
